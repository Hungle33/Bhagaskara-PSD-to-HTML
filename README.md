A more accurate assessment of my current HTML and CSS skills.

This is a more current assessment of my skills. I used evernote SASS to structure my CSS. 
Also used bootstrap for the grid and the carousel.
Coded a responsive team slider whilst using underscoreJS's throttle functionality to optimize it.
One of the more interesting things I've done with this particular project was to include waypoint and animate to create sequential animations on scroll. This technique has been extremely trendy as of late.
Also used a few other Javascript/jQuery plugins to make the page more dynamic. 

Tested in IE9+ and works. Added Javascript placeholder fallback for IE9. Also works in all other modern browsers.
